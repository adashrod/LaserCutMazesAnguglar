        <div class="cut-intro">
            The different parts of the maze are grouped together and given different colors to facilitate printing (see example on left).
            The order that the groups are printed matters and an ideal order is:
        </div>
    </div>
    <ol>
        <li>score/engrave wall numbers and floor numbers (blue, floor and wall mode only)</li>
        <li>cut walls and cut notches in floor and wall mode (black)/cut single maze piece in single sheet mode (black)</li>
        <li>cut outline(s) (red)</li>
        <li>DO NOT cut, score, or engrave the calibration rectangle (green)</li>
        <li>DO NOT cut, score, or engrave the bounding box rectangle (purple)</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The numbers can be scored, or left out entirely. They're only there as a guide for assembly, though assembling a large maze without them could be
            tedious.
        </li>
        <li>
            The outlines should be cut last. Since these cuts cut the piece(s) out of the material, cutting this before could lead to
            anything inside being misaligned.
        </li>
        <li>
            The calibration rectangle serves as a guide for setting up the print job in your printer software and should not be cut, engraved, or scored at
            all. See the section below for more details.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Assembly</h1>
    <h3>floor and wall mode</h3>
    <div class="group">
        <app-lightbox-thumbnail title="Floor Notches" image="LaserCutMazes/assets/notches.png" thumbnailHeight="80"></app-lightbox-thumbnail>
        <div class="numbering-text">
            The floor piece has rectangular notches cut into it (left); the walls have stubs that fit into these notches (right).
            Each pair of notches has a number printed between them, and a wall piece that fits into those notches has the same number printed on it.
        </div>
        <app-lightbox-thumbnail class="right" title="Numbered Wall Pieces" image="LaserCutMazes/assets/wallPieces.png" thumbnailHeight="80"></app-lightbox-thumbnail>
    </div>
    <p>
        If the pieces fit somewhat snugly, you might only need to glue the walls along the outer edge to the floor. If they fit very tightly, you might not need
        to glue them at all.
    </p>
    <h3>single sheet mode</h3>
    <p>In this mode all that is needed is to glue the maze piece onto the floor piece.</p>
</div>
<div class="help-section">
    <h1>Out of Bounds</h1>
    <p>
        If the maze is too big, the pieces won't fit in a single printing area, and you'll get the out-of-bounds warning when the SVG is generated.
        The tool currently doesn't break up the blueprint into multiple SVGs in this case. One solution would be to change any of the maze dimensions to use
        less printing material; if that isn't preferred, you'll need to manually edit the SVG in the SVG editor of your choice to split the print into two or
        more print jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the out-of-bounds situation occurs, the printer's max width and max height values will be used to generate a rectangular bounding box in the SVG
        as a guide. It is displayed as a purple rectangle and anything outside of it will be outside of the printing area.

    <h1>Calibration Rectangle</h1>
    <h3>A need for Calibration</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            If your laser cutter software doesn't respect the pixel density settings (dots/pixels per inch, DPI, etc) then your image won't be the proper size,
            i.e. it will be scaled down or up. The problem with this is that scaling everything down makes the floor notches smaller, (and scaling up makes the
            floor notches bigger), but the material thickness doesn't change, so printing a scaled image would result in wall pieces that wouldn't fit in the
            notches. More specifically, the width of the notches has to be exactly the same size as the material thickness for the pieces to fit together, and
            scaling breaks that. See the following image for an example of this auto-scaling.
        </p>
        <app-lightbox-thumbnail title="Scaled Down" image="LaserCutMazes/assets/improperScale.png" thumbnailWidth="600"></app-lightbox-thumbnail>
        <p>
            The above example maze was created with an 8-inch wide calibration rectangle (highlighted in green), but the image has been scaled down to about
            7.5 inches. In order to fix this, the entire image should be selected and scaled up (stretched) until the calibration rectangle is lined up with
            the 8-inch mark on the ruler.
        </p>
        <app-lightbox-thumbnail title="Corrected Scale" image="LaserCutMazes/assets/correctedScale.png" thumbnailWidth="600"></app-lightbox-thumbnail>
        <p>
            In the second image, the entire blueprint has been scaled back up to make the calibration rectangle the correct size (8 inches wide here),
            ensuring that all pieces are the correct size.
